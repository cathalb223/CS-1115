                <h3>Blackcap</h3>
                <p>Blackcap is a theocracy that sprawls across the Sunscorched mountains and the surrounding deserts. It is ruled by the cardinal Solar Elise Threadwork. The primary temple of The Scorched Goddess is located within the Blackcap volcano, clerics and priests of the religion live in carved hollows within the insides of these mountains. The general populace lives on the outside of the volcanic crater and mountain range in many settlements.</p>
                <p>It is known for its large forge and blacksmithing industry. They create the most reliable and durable metalwork in the world. Culturally they are very religious and devout, with it being slightly taboo to not be a part of at least one of the two religions. </p>

                <h3>Panthal Ocean</h3>
                <p>Ethos’ one and only ocean which wraps around the entire planet. It has never been crossed by humans and much of it isn’t charted. Large monsters are known to prowl its depths. Trade routes litter the areas close to the coasts of the major continents.</p>

                <h3>The Southern Reaches</h3>
                <p>The southern reaches are relatively unknown to the people of Ethos, there have been no successful expeditions across the Panthal ocean this far. What is known is that at the South Pole of the globe there is a large temple to the Frozen King which no mortal crafted. Here he spends half the year, seperate from his worshippers as he holds divine vigil. Unlike the North Pole, there is a lack of wild magic here.</p>
