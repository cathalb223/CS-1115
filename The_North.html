                <h3>Frostfell</h3>
                <p>Frostfell is a citadel of civilization about as far north as you can go. It is surrounded on all sides by dangerous torrents of wild magic and horrible monsters. Its large walls are adorned with spires made of a magical material known as rutilian which absorbs this ambient magic and turns it into electricity. This fact has meant that Frostfell is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of the world technologically. The capital city is built on a geothermal spring which helps the town keep warm in such weather.</p>

                <h3>Ulgrum</h3>
                <p>Radix is an autocracy consisting of a branching web of settlements across the entire continent it resides on. Its capital sits on a truly enormous tree said to have been a gift from The Scorched Goddess. Its leader is a centuries old druid human names Raxis Longhorn who has ruled with an iron fist for decades. The people and government of Radix see technology and most civilisations as abominations and perversions of nature. Their entire settlement is provided for by the environment. Homes are carved into the large roots of the sun tree and farming is done in a very ritualistic manner. Anyone who breaks these rules is used as fertiliser. Druids and those with profound connections to nature make up the ruling class of this civilization. </p>
