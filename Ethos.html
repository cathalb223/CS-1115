            <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>
                Initially when designing Ethos I had it in my head that it was a future version of earth
                wherein something happened that nearly wiped out humanity and introduced magic into the world.
                In doing so I researched into predicted models for the future configuration of the continents.
                Once I found one that I liked I modelled it in a map making software called Incarnate.
            </p>

            <p>
                After creating the map most of my work went into fleshing out and worldbuilding specific
                locations within the world. I wanted each one to have a unique feel so that I would have
                room with whatever stories I wanted to set within the world. This lead to a very biome rich world
                as evidenced by the map above.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Magic System</h3>
            <p>I found the magic system hardest to think about really. I had to balance needs with
                aesthetics and theme. I needed to have both <i>divine</i> and <i>arcane</i> magic (magic
                that comes from a god and magic that is more innate to the world respectively) to tell
                the stories I wanted to tell. But I also wanted magic to have an unstable and almost
                accidental quality to it in the setting
            </p>

            <p>Eventually I came up with the idea that whatever introduced magic to the world was a
                <strong>violent</strong>
                and <strong>catastrophic</strong> event. Many realms crashed into earth and began leaking through.
                In this model magic is a form of radiation that changes things and people that touch it. Divine
                magics
                come from those realms that for one reason or another have developped intelligence.
            </p>

            <h3>Themes</h3>
            <p>
                The themes of this setting were perhaps the easiest aspect to come up with. I am somewhat of a hack
                and at the time of worldbuilding I was revisiting a series that I watched as a child on Youtube.
                While the premise and execution were pretty bad in hindsight, they did deliver in theme and
                atmosphere.
                The moody and oppressive decay of a civilisation that is being constantly stalked by things they do
                not
                understand. A world that feels like it is on the precipice of becoming <i>worse</i> forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                While bleak, I found that exploring those concepts was really appealing to me. So I baked them into
                the
                setting as best as I could.
